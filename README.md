# SoT-Docs
Sea of Thieves SDK Documentation

This documentation was generated with Doxygen, using my personal slimmed down SDK from the [SoT SDK Dump](https://github.com/pubgsdk/SoT-SDK). The entirety of the original SDK is not documented, but most of the commonly used components should be available.

Hierarchy and collaboration graphs are included to easily find needed classes and function/members to lead to those classes.
